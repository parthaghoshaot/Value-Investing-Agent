## Value Investing Principles

This tool is built on timeless investment principles:

### 1. Intrinsic Value
A company's true worth based on future cash flows, not market price.

### 2. Margin of Safety
Buy only when price is significantly below intrinsic value (25%+ discount).

### 3. Economic Moat
Seek durable competitive advantages that protect profits.

### 4. Circle of Competence
Only invest in businesses you understand.

### 5. Mr. Market
Use market emotions as opportunities, don't be ruled by them.
