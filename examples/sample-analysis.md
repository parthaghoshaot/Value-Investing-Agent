## Value Investing Conclusion

🟡 **Hold or Watch**

Apple is a wonderful company with a wide moat, strong brand, and excellent profitability. However, the current price of $185.92 doesn't provide the margin of safety that value investors typically require.

**For existing shareholders:** Continue to hold. Apple's quality justifies holding even at fair value.

**For potential buyers:** Wait for a pullback to below $150 (approximately 20-25% below current price) to establish a position with adequate margin of safety.
